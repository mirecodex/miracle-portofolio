# Setup Dependencies

Before using the new components, install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install three @types/three gsap next-themes
```

Or if you're using yarn:

```bash
yarn add three @types/three gsap next-themes
```

These packages are essential for:

- `three` and `@types/three`: 3D rendering for the ParticleField component
- `gsap`: Animation library for the MorphingShape component
- `next-themes`: Theme management (if not already installed)
